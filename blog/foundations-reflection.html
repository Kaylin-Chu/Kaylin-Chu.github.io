    <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning? </h1>
      <li>I learned I actually don’t mind admitting my faults, I think because I don’t normally write/type I wouldn’t usually admit when I’m doing something wrong or bad because then I’d have to say it out loud. When reflecting, I can kind of say yeah I sucked at that but it’s over now, how will I do better next time? </li>
      <li>Another thing, is that I’m not willing to lead or rather I’m not willing to show first, it’s been quite awkward for me to send my blogs in the discord chat. I saw it the first time, I saw no one had done it so I didn’t either. Even though, I’m quite happy being me, I’m still not willing to make myself vulnerable FIRST. </li>
      <li>There are some things that I was wrong about in terms of Human Skills, I was incredibly worried about foundations being self-motivated and flexible with timing, I thought I needed a brick and mortar to attend, then I learned about the flipped classroom and chilled out a bit. I wouldn’t say I had a fixed mindset but I  definitely didn’t have a growth mindset so that’s another thing I learnt / changed. </li>
    <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h1>
      In coding, I reckon empathy towards oneself when one gets stuck is so important. It’s so easy to get frustrated when one can’t solve something alone but you don’t know, what you don’t know and there’s so many avenues for help if one just takes a breath and reachs out. 
      One of the whakataukī I’ve mentioned before that represents my values well is
      <br> 
      <strong>“Kaua e hoki i te waewae tūtuki, ā, āpā anō hei te ūpoko pakaru.”</strong> - Do not turn back because of stumbling feet but only for a broken head.   
      In learning and coding, it can be so easy to give up when something goes wrong or you don’t understand but if you keep going, you can strive to success. 
    <h1>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h1> 
      How much I liked it, I sort of thought it was a bit hippy dippy but I liked the change of pace in comparison with coding. Neither of my friends that have gone through DevAcademy mentioned it, though they did mention how tough bootcamp is/was. 
      I think the other thing I found surprising is how much I enjoy reflecting, I don’t normally journal or write at all to be honest, and it’s quite nice to just type my thoughts. I have found that I’ve gone off on a tangent a few times though so that’s maybe not so ideal. 
    <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h1> 
      I really did not enjoy the listening and looping, I felt immense pressure to listen and not get distracted, I struggled not to interject in agreement. It was just a hard task, I like to think I have a pretty good memory so the looping was fine but I was just so stressed that my memory would fail me so I kept trying to remember things while I was listening and I think that made it worse. Another thing, I found difficult was trying to explain my identity and values, it’s something I show in my everyday life, something ingrained in me, and I just found it hard to explain with words instead of action. 
    <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1> 
      Everything I remember, is saying to get along with the team at the job we hopefully get. Obviously, it’s deeper than that but being the right fit and learning and adapting to their way of code after so like a bit of acing the interview but also acing the job. I also think it’s easy to get a bit lost in your own world if you’re working from home and staring at a computer all day not really interacting with others, so I’m hopeful Human skills helps with that too. 
      <h1>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. </h1>
      Nah, I’m pretty happy with what I’ve learnt in Human Skills. Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset especially helped me destress. I did also like the flipped classroom videos they helped me understand why foundations is set up the way it is and reassured me that this would be helpful long term when I need help.
