    <p><strong>An ethical decision I have made </strong> is to boycott companies that support the
    genocide of the Palestinians. Almost 2 years ago, my household said goodbye
    to McDonald’s, Burger King, Coca Cola, Disney+ among others. We struggle
    with Coca Cola every now and then, since many establishments only offer
    drinks that fall under the Coca Cola branch, but we learn, and we adjust. I
    don’t regret not supporting these companies at all, if it means even $1 less
    is funding genocide then it’s worth it. 
  </p>
  <p>My cultures are <strong>Samoan</strong> and <strong>Chinese</strong>
    which are very similar and very different at the same time, I also spend a
    lot of time immersed in the Māori culture living in such a progressive city,
    having attended schooling that offers Māori immersion learning and having a
    Māori partner. In terms of values, growing up in brown communities meant
    visiting extended family every weekend if not more, it means helping out
    wherever you can whether that’s vacuuming the floors, doing airport pickups
    or just making the tea and coffee. That’s not to say Chinese people aren’t
    hard workers too, I recall making wontons for my aunt’s fish ‘n’ chip shop
    at 5 but the family commitments are different, the occasional yum cha and
    then see you at the next funeral / wedding. Chinese have a long and great
    culture with many traditions, but I find them more pressuring than
    supportive like in Samoan culture.

    <strong>Some whakataukī I resonate with are: </strong>
    <br>
    <strong><em>“Kāore te kumara e kōrero mō tōna ake reka”</em></strong> – The kumara does not say how
    sweet he is. This whakataukī is all about humility, no one above, no one
    beneath. 
    <br>
    <strong><em>“Ko te rātā ta rākau i takahia e te moa”</em></strong> - The rātā was the tree
    trampled down by the moa. The rātā tree cannot grow tall if stood on as a
    sapling, it must lean on another for support. Influences early in life have
    a big impact - ‘as the twig is bent so grows the tree’. 
    <br>
    <strong><em>“Kaua e hoki i te waewae tūtuki, ā, āpā anō hei te ūpoko pakaru.”</em></strong> - Do not turn back because
    of stumbling feet but only for a broken head. To not to be deterred by small
    setbacks but to push ahead to success. 
    <p> Previously, when I’ve done the
    Strengths quiz my top 10 strengths in order were Honesty, Kindness, Bravery,
    Leadership, Curiosity, Love, Creativity, Social Intelligence, Zest and
    Humour. My fifth strength of being Curious will support me by allowing me to
    explore software development and problem solve when I can. I did the DOPE
    personality test and got Peacock (45%). Hopefully, being a Peacock will mean
    I am willing to ask for help and be eager to get underway.

    I'm not super great at keeping on task. I get distracted quite easily when working at a
    desk / on a computer. Probably one of the reasons, I’ve always had jobs
    where I mainly work with my hands and have about an hour a day at a desk /
    on a computer. This means I can take longer to learn things just because it
    takes longer to sink in. In Career Development, I think I often sell myself
    short, it feels strange to showcase myself, I like to let my work speak for
    itself but obviously that doesn’t work in an interview. In my last job, I
    did end up asking for a raise because I’d taken so much extra work on and
    only gotten a 1% raise when inflation was 7%, they offered 3% and I decided
    that was good enough I didn’t want to ‘complain’ again but in the end I left
    the job so it clearly wasn’t. </p>

    With my last employer, one of the team members
    regularly made comments about other staff members. She also had a tendency
    to be rude to and about patients. I found it difficult not to stand up for
    my coworkers and I tried to de-escalate the situation, which was not very
    effective. It reached a point where our manager had to have a chat about
    what was and was not ok in the workplace. I had to realise that I can’t
    control her, and I let her know it was possibly due to stress from the job.
    We were able interact kindly with one another after that. In future if
    something like that happened again, I’d probably just go straight to the
    relevant manager.</p>
