    <h3>Long term goal / Career Pathway</h3>
      <p>
        Coming into Dev Academy, I wanted flexibility in hours and location.
        Future planning for long-term or children. Being a developer affords those
        benefits, I’d love to work for a not-for-profit or at least a company I
        feel is making a change, other Dev Academy alumni I know have worked for
        UNICEF, Open Polytech and global crowdfunding companies.
      </p>
    <h3>My learning strengths and limitations</h3>
      <p>
        I work well when in a team, I like to bounce ideas off others, learn from
        others, teach what I know or just decompress a bit. I enjoy learning and
        love problem solving. I have a pretty good attention to detail and memory,
        I like to think I’m a quick learner and I enjoy mathematics, which I think
        stems from there being a correct answer unlike English which can be
        subjective and based on interpretation. In terms of
        <strong>limitations</strong>, I can get distracted easily and struggle
        with motivation and procrastination. I find deadlines helpful to
        counteract and manage these obstacles. I can get frustrated easily but as
        long as I take breaks when I hit a wall, I cope.
      </p>
    <h3>Human Skills I’d like to develop at Dev Academy</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection</strong> – I'd really like to work on my reflection
        skills, I haven’t really done daily reflection before, I usually forget
        before it becomes a habit. <strong>Time management</strong> – The pomodoro
        timer is helping but I often forgot to set and stop it, so sometimes it’s
        a bit under what I’ve done and other times it’s criminally over.
        <strong>Growth-mindset</strong> – Working on not doing things to avoid
        making mistakes.
      </p>
    <h3>Workload Commitment</h3>
      <p>
        So far, I have managed my workload to do at least the overview on Monday,
        the bulk of the work on Tuesday and Wednesday, finish the rest on Thursday
        if I need to and then at least 30 minutes a day for the rest of the week.
        Obviously, this will change during bootcamp but for the first 2 sprints
        with being sick and attending an out-of-town tangi, this worked for me.
        <br>
        <strong> How I will work productively and safely with others </strong> - I find it easier to
        get majority done at the beginning of the week and then I have the weekend
        to overflow into if I get really stuck. I do prioritise a work-life
        balance, but I find it hard to relax on the weekend if I know I haven’t
        completed the work. I think this will work well with others because I’ll
        be on top of my work at the beginning of the week but also open to
        weekends for group projects etc. 
        <br>
        <strong>If things start to build up</strong>, I will
        identify the most urgent tasks and prioritise them. If I can’t complete
        the broken-down tasks within business hours, slowing down and using my
        evenings and weekends allows me to relax and makes the work less
        overwhelming. If necessary, I will seek help from my cohort, the wider
        foundations team or the facilitation team. 
      </p>
    <h3>Commitment to how and where I’ll seek help in a timely way</h3> 
      <p>
        I sort of mentioned this in my workload
        commitment, but I can seek help from my cohort, the wider foundations team
        or the facilitation team. I would do this on a Thursday morning latest to
        ensure I have adequate time to finish the set tasks. I would use discord
        channels to ask for help, it seems to be the most responsive so far. 
      </p>
    <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation team </h3>
      <p>
        I expect at least one weekly check in
        (currently Wednesday 11am), guidance when needed, sometimes just a nod in
        the right direction. Clear concise communication and discussion fostering
        with open ended questions, so far so good.
      </p> 
    <h3>Scheduling conflicts </h3>
      <p>
        In terms
        of routine commitments, I don’t have any that are immovable. I normally
        have a yoga class at 6pm on Mondays but there are others I can attend.
        Tangi are non-negotiable but I don’t have any planned travel for weddings
        or vacations.
