    Long term goal / Career Pathway Coming into Dev Academy, I wanted
    flexibility in hours and location. Future planning for long-term or
    children. Being a developer affords those benefits, I’d love to work for a
    not-for-profit or at least a company I feel is making a change, other Dev
    Academy alumni I know have worked for UNICEF, Open Polytech and global
    crowdfunding companies. My learning strengths and limitations I work well
    when in a team, I like to bounce ideas off others, learn from others, teach
    what I know or just decompress a bit. I enjoy learning and love problem
    solving. I have a pretty good attention to detail and memory, I like to
    think I’m a quick learner and I enjoy mathematics, which I think stems from
    there being a correct answer unlike English which can be subjective and
    based on interpretation. In terms of limitations, I can get distracted
    easily and struggle with motivation and procrastination. I find deadlines
    helpful to counteract and manage these obstacles. I can get frustrated
    easily but as long as I take breaks when I hit a wall, I cope. Human skills
    I’d like to develop at Dev Academy Reflection – I'd really like to work on
    my reflection skills, I haven’t really done daily reflection before, I
    usually forget before it becomes a habit. Time management – The pomodoro
    timer is helping but I often forgot to set and stop it, so sometimes it’s a
    bit under what I’ve done and other times it’s criminally over.
    Growth-mindset – Working on not doing things to avoid making mistakes
    Workload Commitment So far, I have managed my workload to do at least the
    overview on Monday, the bulk of the work on Tuesday and Wednesday, finish
    the rest on Thursday if I need to and then at least 30 minutes a day for the
    rest of the week. Obviously, this will change during bootcamp but for the
    first 2 sprints with being sick and attending an out-of-town tangi, this
    worked for me. How I will work productively and safely with others - I find
    it easier to get majority done at the beginning of the week and then I have
    the weekend to overflow into if I get really stuck. I do prioritise a
    work-life balance, but I find it hard to relax on the weekend if I know I
    haven’t completed the work. I think this will work well with others because
    I’ll be on top of my work at the beginning of the week but also open to
    weekends for group projects etc. If things start to build up, I will
    identify the most urgent tasks and prioritise them. If I can’t complete the
    broken-down tasks within business hours, slowing down and using my evenings
    and weekends allows me to relax and makes the work less overwhelming. If
    necessary, I will seek help from my cohort, the wider foundations team or
    the facilitation team. Commitment to how and where I’ll seek help in a
    timely way I sort of mentioned this in my workload commitment, but I can
    seek help from my cohort, the wider foundations team or the facilitation
    team. I would do this on a Thursday morning latest to ensure I have adequate
    time to finish the set tasks. I would use discord channels to ask for help,
    it seems to be the most responsive so far. What I expect from the
    Facilitation team I expect at least one weekly check in (currently Wednesday
    11am), guidance when needed, sometimes just a nod in the right direction.
    Clear concise communication and discussion fostering with open ended
    questions, so far so good. Scheduling conflicts In terms of routine
    commitments, I don’t have any that are immovable. I normally have a yoga
    class at 6pm on Mondays but there are others I can attend. Tangi are
    non-negotiable but I don’t have any planned travel for weddings or
    vacations.
