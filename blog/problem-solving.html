    <h1>Blocked on a simple problem</h1>
      A really simple problem I got stuck on was during the flipflop task. 
      The flipflop task aims to write a function where multiples of 3 are replaced with 'flip', multiples of 5 are replaced with 'flop' and multiples of 15 are replaced with 'flipflop'.
      I have attached a picture of the intended output
      <br>
      <img src="../Flipflop task.png"/>
      <style>
        img {
          height: 400px;
          width: 200px;
        }
      </style>
      <br>
      I put the 15 division parameter last and I couldn't understand why the file wasn't returning flipflop and just kept returning flip. 
      Eventually, I figured out I had ordered the conditions incorrectly. 
      I used the <strong>error messages</strong> to solve the issue, the error message said the expected result 'flipflop' did not match the returned result 'flip'.
      I also sort of used <strong>asking your peers for help</strong> by checking the Discord threads to double check my code.
      It was nice to solve the issue and completely understand the solution. 
      I learned the 15 had to go first because 3 and 5 go into 15 but 15 doesn't go into 3 and 5.
      The code is read top to bottom so makes sense that 15 must go first.
    <h1>Elegantly solved a problem</h1>
      Doing the deBee task, I felt like it was easy to begin because it was so similar to the Capitalize task that I had just done.
      The deBee task would like a string (in this case, a sentence) to have all the 'buzz' words taken out no matter whether upper or lower case.
      It was easy for me to split and join the sentence back together because I had just done it but to take out the uppercase 'buzz' words was a bit harder.
      First, I used <strong>Googling</strong> to problem solve. I looked up the .filter command and then specified that I wanted remove an exact word/s.
      That gave me a block of code changing the output to all lowercase which helped remove the 'buzz' words no matter the case.
      The only part I didn't understand was why !== (strict inequality) and not === (strict equality) was used after changing to lowercase, I thought it could be the quotation marks?
      The initial block of code from Google gave me strict equality so the code didn't work until I <strong>tried something</strong> (strict inequality) which then worked.
      I felt really lucky that I found pretty much the perfect code while I was doing my ground work, but in the end I think it was more harming because I don't really understand my final product.
      I did learn how to use the .filter command though so not a total waste.
    <h1>Confidence with Problem-solving Processes</h1>
      <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - I'm sure it would be super helpful if I knew what I was doing, but at the moment I find it easier to just progress with the steps as I go.
      <strong>Trying something</strong> - The process I use the most and am most confident doing.
      <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I mostly just read aloud / talk to myself. Every now and then, I make my partner listen since I've yet to buy a rubber duck.
      <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I enjoy the ease of error messages, knowing exactly which line is causing the error.
      <strong>Console.logging</strong> - I'm not super comfortable with console.log, I understand it in theory but I struggle to actually use it unless I use previous files that are already connected to html.
      <strong>Googling</strong> - The process I use the secondmost and very confident doing. It can be a bit unfortunate when google gives whole blocks of code so I feel like I'm not learning anything.
      <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - I often ask on Discord, but first I check if anyone else had the same problem so I don't have to ask again
      <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - Yet to use this method directly. But I have had facilitators reach out via Discord.
      <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - Something I'm working on, I do this with google code but would like to and could improve in this area.
    <h1>Reluctant to ask for help</h1>
      Basically anytime I ask for help it's reluctant. It's hard to ask for help because of the vulnerability and fear of being perceived.
      It's hard asking for help when you feel like everyone else is ahead of you and can do it themselves. 
      I try really hard to avoid comparing my work to others but it's difficult when asking for help.
      Next time and every time, I try to imagine my reaction if others ask for help and remember that everyone else is learning too so I don't have to worry.
