    <h1>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
      <p>
        The easiest way to understand JavaScript for me is the wizard, even my partner could understand once I showed him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78&ab_channel=DanielleTh%C3%A9">this video</a>.
        HTML builds the website, CSS designs the website and JavaScript is the magic (Wizard) that makes everything happen without refreshing the page.
        eg. Pausing a video on youtube
        <br>
        Others I like are:
        <ul>
          <li>The web page is a grocery store: HTML is the building and everything inside (shelves, counters, products etc). CSS is the layout of the store (shelves,counters, product arrangement on the shelves, plus the paint and decorations). JavaScript is the employees that operate the store.</li>
          <li>The web page is a house. HTML is the blueprint, CSS is the interior decorating scheme, and JavaScript is the electricals. The web browser is the builder.</li>
        </ul>
        What I understand from all of these analogies is HTML and CSS is necessary for Javascript to function but without Javascript, a web page is just a pretty note accessible online.
      </p>
    <h1>Control flow and Loops</h1>
      Loops are a sequence of instructions in code that repeats as many times as the user sets, usually until a condition is met.
      Control flow is the order that coded instructions happen. Code is run top line to bottom line <strong>unless</strong> the control flow is changed with code.
      Conditionals can skip code or loops can loop a section of code over and over changing the control flow.
      This is an example process of cooking Japanese curry for dinner.
      Gather the ingredients (grocery store, pantry, fridge etc)
      Prepare the ingredients (cut chicken, carrots, potatoes, onions)
      Cook the ingredients (saute, stir fry)
      Add water & curry mix
      Simmer until ready
      The instructions to cook dinner will be followed top to bottom, just like how a computer reads code, this is Control Flow.
      In loops, these steps will only be done if conditions are met.
      So 'cooking dinner' conditions would be the user is hungry, it's the evening, no other plans (leftovers, dinner out). 
      For example, this loop would be run <strong>up to</strong> 7 times a week. 
    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
      <p>
        DOM stands for Document Object Model
        DOM is a programming interface for web documents. 
        The browser creates DOM when loading HTML documents and arranges the elements in tree-like structure. 
        The DOM represents the webpage so the user (via programs) can interact with document structure, style, and content.
        JavaScript is one of the programs the user can use to interact with content within a website.
        The DOM is represented as a Javascript Object and is the exact same <!--(a copy)--> as the HTML file.
        HTML is the language of the web and has specific syntax and rules - not general grammar.
        The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form the trees, the browser knows how to because of the DOM.
        <a><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/DOM-model.svg/1200px-DOM-model.svg.png"> ← The aforementioned tree-like structure</a>
        <style>
          img {
            height: 50vw;
            width: 50vw;
          }
          /* widescreen displays */
        @media only screen and (min-width: 920px) {
          img {
            height: auto;
            width: 30%;}}
        </style>
      </p>
        I have also seen the DOM described as "A Web API used to build websites, built using multiple APIs that work together"
        <br>
        API = Application Programming Interface
    <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h1>
        To access data from arrays, the user must refer to the element number, the number at which the element is placed. 
        In coding, counting starts at 0, similar to how buildings start with a ground level then the first floor and so on.
        To access data from objects, the user can use dot notation or bracket notation. Nested objects can be output(ted) too, nested objects refer to objects within objects.
        Arrays and objects often get compared because they both data structures to hold information. 
        An easy way to tell the difference is arrays are usually in square brackets [array] and objects are usually curly brackets {object}
        <br>
        <a><img src="/Accessing data from objects.png">← Example of accessing data from objects</a>
    <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h1>
        Functions are blocks of code that complete a task or tasks. 
        Functions aid in breaking a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces (functions).
        Functions are easily read and once defined, can be reused multiple times without having to be written out multiple times. 
        Because functions are easily read and understandable, it is easy to fix mistakes/remove bugs.
