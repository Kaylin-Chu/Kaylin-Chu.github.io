    <h2>Long term goal / Career Pathway</h2>
        Coming into Dev Academy, I wanted flexibility in hours and location for my next career.
        Future planning for long-term or children. Being a developer affords those
        benefits, I’d love to work for a not-for-profit or at least a company I
        feel is making a change, other Dev Academy alumni I know have worked for
        UNICEF, Open Polytech and global crowdfunding companies.
        <br>
        <strong>
          <h2>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for?</h2>
          <h3>I hope to work in the tech industry as a developer, at least for a little while. 
          I can see myself in a team setting and I'd love to work remotely overseas for a little bit to be able to spend time with family while affording my mortgage.
          </h3>
          <h2>What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</h2>
          <h3>Having previously worked in healthcare and with children as well as volunteering for a variety of charities, I feel the need to make a positive impact in my community.
          Ideally, I'd love to work in a job where I can help people or feel like I'm giving back in some way. 
          Working in Education, Healthcare, or for a Not for Profit would be the dream!
          </h3>
        </strong>
    <h2>My learning strengths and limitations</h2>
        I work well when in a team, I like to bounce ideas off others, learn from
        others, teach what I know or just decompress a bit. I enjoy learning and
        love problem solving. I have a pretty good attention to detail and memory, 
        I like to think I’m a quick learner and I enjoy mathematics, which I think
        stems from there being a correct answer unlike English which can be
        subjective and based on interpretation. In terms of<strong>limitations</strong>, 
        I can get distracted easily and struggle with motivation and procrastination. 
        I find deadlines helpful to counteract and manage these obstacles. 
        I can get frustrated easily but as long as I take breaks when I hit a wall, I cope.
          <strong>
            <h2>Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations?</h2> 
            <h3>Not particularly, though I don't think my attention to detail is as good as I thought. 
            A lot of my mistakes come from syntax errors.
            I think working at home alone has shown me how much I enjoy social interaction and asking for help in person.</h3>
            <h2>Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h2>
            <h3>I never noticed how easy it is for me to get sidetracked and I don't think I've procrastined as much as the last 2 weeks. 
            Hopefully, I'll find it much easier to stay on track once bootcamp starts and I'm in at the dedicated study space.</h3>
          </strong>
    <h2><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          <h3> Staying on top of the material will probably be my biggest downfall. 
          I'm aiming to finish all the assignments within my allocated study hours (9-5) but I'm willing to do extra after hours if need be.
          </h3>
    </strong>
    <h2>Human Skills I’d like to develop at Dev Academy</h2>
        <strong>Reflection</strong> – I'd really like to work on my reflection
        skills, I haven’t really done daily reflection before, I usually forget
        before it becomes a habit. 
        <br>
        <strong>Time management</strong> – The pomodoro
        timer is helping but I often forgot to set and stop it, so sometimes it’s
        a bit under what I’ve done and other times it’s criminally over.
        <br>
        <strong>Growth-mindset</strong> – Working on not doing things to avoid
        making mistakes.
        <strong>
          <h2>What are some areas for development you would like to work on?</h2>
          <h3> I would love to improve my self-awareness, in particular, my reflective skills. 
          I haven't really done a lot of reflection before because when I've tried, I've stopped before it became a habit.
          I have multiple reflection books, 'Highlight of my day', 'Something I'm grateful for today', a Tuhi Wellbeing journal, endless travel journals but I never seem to finish them.
          I did the 'highlight of my day' one everyday for 2.5 years but it's still unfinished.
          </h3>
        </strong>
    <h2>Workload Commitment</h2>
        So far, I have managed my workload to do at least the overview on Monday,
        the bulk of the work on Tuesday and Wednesday, finish the rest on Thursday
        if I need to and then at least 30 minutes a day for the rest of the week.
        Obviously, this will change during bootcamp but for the first 2 sprints
        with being sick and attending an out-of-town tangi, this worked for me.
        <br>
        <strong> How I will work productively and safely with others </strong> - I find it easier to
        get majority done at the beginning of the week and then I have the weekend
        to overflow into if I get really stuck. I do prioritise a work-life
        balance, but I find it hard to relax on the weekend if I know I haven’t
        completed the work. I think this will work well with others because I’ll
        be on top of my work at the beginning of the week but also open to
        weekends for group projects etc. 
        <br>
        <strong>If things start to build up</strong>, I will
        identify the most urgent tasks and prioritise them. If I can’t complete
        the broken-down tasks within business hours, slowing down and using my
        evenings and weekends allows me to relax and makes the work less
        overwhelming. If necessary, I will seek help from my cohort, the wider
        foundations team or the facilitation team.
    <h2>Commitment to how and where I’ll seek help in a timely way</h2>
        I sort of mentioned this in my workload
        commitment, but I can seek help from my cohort, the wider foundations team
        or the facilitation team. I would do this on a Thursday morning latest to
        ensure I have adequate time to finish the set tasks. I would use discord
        channels to ask for help, it seems to be the most responsive so far. 
      <strong><h2>Workload Commitment Update 
        <br> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp? How and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h2>
        <h3>I'll be in at the dedicated workspace as much as possible, which at the moment is everyday.
        I expect to complete my work within the hours I have allocated, 9-5 Mon-Fri. 
        I hope it will be a lot easier for me to ask for help, I should be face to face with at least one person from my cohort everyday.
        I'm also happy to ask for help on Discord now, I've done it a few times, with the entire foundations group, with my cohort and also with my facilitator.
        I assume because bootcamp is a bit more structured, I'll be able to ask for help sooner than I have been just because I'll be able to tell if I'm keeping to timeframe or not.</h3>
      </strong>
    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team </h2>
        I expect at least one weekly check in
        (currently Wednesday 11am), guidance when needed, sometimes just a nod in
        the right direction. Clear concise communication and discussion fostering
        with open ended questions, so far so good.
        <strong><h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <h3>Again, weekly check ins, one tech in and one check in. 
          I'd prefer them to be in the start to middle of the week, just so the stuff I want to discuss is fresh in my mind and then I can implement throughout the rest of the week.
          I'd like the check ins to be routine in that the time/day doesn't differ too much.
          And then yeah, open honest communication with constructive gentle feedback.</h3></strong>
    <h2>Scheduling conflicts </h2>
        In terms of routine commitments, I don’t have any that are immovable. I normally
        have a yoga class at 6pm on Mondays but there are others I can attend.
        Tangi are non-negotiable but I don’t have any planned leave for weddings, vacations or otherwise.
