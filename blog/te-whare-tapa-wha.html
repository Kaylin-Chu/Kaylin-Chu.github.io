    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h1>
      I usually refer to the model as 'Whare Tapa Wha', the model is based on a house not being able to stand without all 4 walls and often includes the land the house stands on.
      Technically a house could stand if one wall had been destoryed but it would eventually decay further if not fixed. 
      Whare tapa wha focuses on working all 4 walls/wellbeings to be the strongest house/person one can be.
    <h1>Taha Tinana (Physical)</h1>

      <li>x2 Dog walks per day. Currently trying to implement dog <strong>runs</strong> on Monday, Wednesday, Friday</li>
