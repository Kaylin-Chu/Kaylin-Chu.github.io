  <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
<!--Compare CSS concepts to determine the differences
Explain how and when to use CSS concepts -->
    On a very basic level; 
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Border</strong> is the ring around the outside of the text (element/content) </li>
    <li><strong>Padding</strong> is the space between the text and the border </li>
    <li><strong>Margin</strong> is the space around the border </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    It looks a bit like a square target, the text is the bullseye then the outer ring is the padding then the border
    and then the margin. 
    </p>
    <strong> Text > Padding > Border > Margin </strong>
    <p>
    One way to tell the difference is to use Will McGugan's mnemonic, 'padded cell'. 
    In a padded cell, the padding goes on the inside. 
    </p>

    Other things to note:
    <ul>
    <li>Thickening the borders will change to the element size. To outline without changing the element size, use the "outline" command. </li>
    <li>Borders make margins non-collapsible</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
