    <h1>How understanding neuroplasticity benefits people </h1>
      Neuroplasticity is the organising of neurons in the brain. 
      Understanding Neuroplasticity benefits people by allowing them to believe they can. 
      The belief that one can find capacity to be / learn / do more rather than being stuck in a rut eg. A losing streak. 
      Knowing that one can improve through learning and trying encourages learning and trying fostering improvement!
    <h1>Engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit</h1> 
      My favourite advice / saying has always been try, try and try again but sometimes it can be hard to remember. 
      Learning that intelligence is malleable has already been so helpful because I was a little apprehensive doing the first several weeks with very minimal in person assistance. 
      Doing the ‘Your Brain’ exercise as part of the student prep was extremely helpful. 
      At the beginning of my DevAcademy journey, I was aiming for 30 minutes per day including weekends just to keep it fresh in my mind. 
      That worked for the first three and a half weeks, but I haven’t done any for the last week because I’ve been so sick. 
      I hope to continue doing 30 minutes a day minimum going forward, that will keep the neuron freeway busy and ensure more lanes are open. 
      <br>

    <h1>Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h1>
      <li>Brain training exercises / games like Sudoku, Crosswords, Wordsearches etc</li> 
      <li>Practice, practice, practice – Coding every day for at least 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Learning new things and becoming confident in the little things – I did my first Wednesday Waffle in HTML</li>
    <h1>Useful Neuroplasticity resource</h1> 
      I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g&t=&ab_channel=Sentis">this video</a> simple and straightforward. It is a short watch and explains neuroplasticity well using a diagram animation.
    <h1>Growth Mindset and it's relevance</h1>
      Growth mindset is the belief you can grow skills. 
      Nurture rather than Nature, something you can be taught or learn rather than something you are born with. 
      Believing one can be better or even the best if they train often enough, makes one more likely to attempt new things and challenge themselves. 
      For example, Coding isn’t something you’re born with and everyone starts a beginner, there are no bad questions.  
    <h1>Exploration surprises & changes</h1> 
      I am more confident in my own ability, still nervous but I do enjoy the saying that nervousness is just excitement in another form, they are both anticipation and I hope to make it positive anticipation. 
    <h1>Integrating growth mindset into my learning journey</h1> 
      I will continue to challenge myself with attempting new things, Javascript has been a bit difficult so far but I’m confident I’ll be able to pick it up soon. 
      I hope to look back at this when I am feeling stuck, I can’t say I will but a positive mindset goes a long way. 
      Me and my growth mindset can take me all the way.  
    <h1>Engaging Growth Mindset resource</h1> 
      While I thoroughly enjoyed Carol Dweck’s TedTalk, I find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6LLxTcVN9k&ab_channel=MentalHealthCenterKids">this video</a> engaging because of the cute drawings and how easy it is to understand, it is made for children after all.
